## 3. Instrument Matrix — Which Lane Each Actor Uses

![Instrument matrix](assets/02_instrument_matrix.png)

Read by instrument, the competition for {r} sorts cleanly: **Economic → {ABBR[lead['Economic']]}**,
**Social → {ABBR[lead['Social']]}**, **Military → {ABBR[lead['Military']]}**, **Diplomacy →
{ABBR[lead['Diplomacy']]}**. Each actor competes in the lane that fits its regional model rather
than going head-to-head across all four. **(H)**

## 4. Initiatives Targeting {r}

![Initiatives targeting {r}](assets/05_initiatives.png)

*Validated for alignment: only events where {r} is the **primary** recipient are shown — named in
the title, holding ≥40% of the event's recipient mentions, or the sole top recipient.
{s.get('initiatives_dropped_peripheral', 0)} peripheral events (where {r} was only mentioned in
passing on another country's initiative — e.g., regional spillover) were excluded.*

  June 2025 Israel-Iran war). **(M)**

- **Caveat:** this measures *reported* influence; the soft-power lens under-captures hard power, and
  dollar figures are announced, not verified. {"For " + r + ", a high U.S. share reflects crisis/alliance involvement rather than economic courtship." if crisis else ""}

## The pattern
- **China leads the Economic and Social lanes in almost every Gulf/Arab state** — the
  development-and-culture patron — while **the U.S. leads Military and Diplomacy** in those same
  states. The **U.S.-security + China-capital division of labor holds recipient by recipient.**
- **Turkey leads the reconstruction theaters** (Syria, Iraq, Libya).
- **Iran leads only where the Resistance arc runs** (the Oman back-channel; Lebanon/Iraq social) and
  is marginal once its self-reporting is stripped.
