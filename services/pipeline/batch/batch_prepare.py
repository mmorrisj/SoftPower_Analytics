    sys_prompt = """You are an expert at tracking events across their lifecycle in news coverage.

**CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING:**
Events evolve through stages over time. Your task is to group event names that refer to the SAME underlying event, EVEN IF they are at different stages.

**Event Lifecycle Stages:**
- ANNOUNCEMENT: "China announces Belt and Road Forum"
- PREPARATION: "China preparing for Belt and Road Forum"
- EXECUTION: "Belt and Road Forum begins in Beijing"
- CONTINUATION: "Belt and Road Forum continues with trade deals"
- AFTERMATH: "Belt and Road Forum concludes with 50 agreements"

**Your Task:**
Analyze the following list of event names that were clustered together. Identify which event names refer to the SAME underlying event across different stages, and which are DISTINCT events.

**Context:**
- These events all occurred on the same date
- They are all initiated by the same country
- The clustering algorithm grouped them based on semantic similarity
- The algorithm often groups topically related but DISTINCT events together

**Examples:**

✅ SAME EVENT - Group Together (same event at different stages):
- "China announces South-South Cooperation Forum"
- "Preparations underway for South-South Cooperation Forum"
- "South-South Cooperation Forum opens in Beijing"
- "South-South Cooperation Forum concludes with cooperation agreements"
→ All refer to same forum at different lifecycle stages

✅ SAME EVENT - Group Together (same event, different wording):
- "President Xi visits Egypt for bilateral talks"
- "Xi Jinping state visit to Egypt"
- "China-Egypt summit during Xi's Cairo visit"
→ All refer to same visit

✅ SAME EVENT - Group Together (same event, different aspects):
- "Beijing Declaration", "Beijing Agreement", "Beijing Summit Agreement"
→ All refer to same agreement
- "Arbaeen Pilgrimage", "Arbaeen Pilgrimage Support", "Arbaeen Healthcare Services"
→ All aspects of same pilgrimage event

❌ DIFFERENT EVENTS - Keep Separate (different instances):
- "First China-Arab States Cooperation Forum"
- "Second China-Arab States Cooperation Forum"
→ Different instances of the same type of event

❌ DIFFERENT EVENTS - Keep Separate (different topics with same partner):
- "China signs trade deal with Egypt"
- "China signs defense cooperation with Egypt"
→ Different agreements, even with same country

❌ DIFFERENT EVENTS - Keep Separate (same type, different partners):
- "China signs trade deal with Egypt"
- "China signs trade deal with UAE"
→ Different countries = different events

❌ DIFFERENT EVENTS - Keep Separate (topically related but distinct):
- "Belt and Road Initiative", "Beijing Declaration", "25-year Cooperation Plan"
→ Three separate diplomatic initiatives
- "Humanitarian Aid to Gaza", "Ceasefire Negotiations", "UN Security Council Meeting"
→ Related to same conflict but three distinct events

**Your Goal:**
- Group event names that refer to the SAME core event (even at different stages)
- Keep DISTINCT events in separate groups
- Err on the side of grouping if it's the same core event evolving over time"""

    user_prompt = f"""Event names from cluster (cluster_id={cluster.cluster_id}, size={cluster.cluster_size}):
{names_list}

**ANALYZE USING CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT:**

**STEP 1 - IDENTIFY CORE EVENTS:**
For each event name, extract the core event:
- What is the main activity? (summit, visit, agreement, project, announcement, etc.)
- Who are the key actors? (countries, organizations, leaders)
- What is the context? (location, initiative, purpose)

**STEP 2 - MATCH ACROSS STAGES:**
Group events that share the same core, even if they differ in:
- Stage indicators: "announces", "preparing", "begins", "ongoing", "concludes", "resulted in"
- Temporal markers: "upcoming", "scheduled", "started", "continuing", "ended"
- Outcome language: "will", "plans to", "is", "has", "completed"

**STEP 3 - DISTINGUISH TRULY DIFFERENT EVENTS:**
Keep events SEPARATE if they are:
- Different instances: "First meeting" vs "Second meeting"
- Different topics: "Trade agreement" vs "Defense cooperation" (both with same country)
- Different entities: "China-Egypt summit" vs "China-UAE summit"
- Different projects: "Port project in Egypt" vs "Railway project in Egypt"

**STEP 4 - VALIDATION:**
For each potential group, verify:
- If tracking this event's lifecycle, would all these headlines fit the same timeline?
- Could these be different news sources reporting the SAME event at different stages?
- Or are these genuinely DIFFERENT events (even if similar)?

- If there are THREE distinct events: {{"reasoning": "...", "same_event": false, "groups": [[1,2], [3], [4,5,6]], "stages_identified": [], "confidence": 0.85}}

**IMPORTANT:**
- Every number from 1 to {len(unique_names)} must appear in exactly one group
- Create as many groups as there are distinct real-world events
- Group events that are the SAME core event at different lifecycle stages
- Only keep events separate if you're confident they're truly distinct events (confidence >= 0.80)"""

**Scoring Scale (use precise anchors):**

1.0-2.0: **Routine/Ceremonial** — No new commitments or outcomes
  - Anniversary celebrations, cultural festivals, flag-raising ceremonies
  - Speeches reaffirming existing positions with no new elements
  - Routine diplomatic courtesy visits with no agenda
  - Score 1.0: Pure ceremony. Score 2.0: Ceremony with minor symbolic gesture (gift exchange, joint statement)

2.5-3.5: **Symbolic with Signal Value** — No material commitment but sends a political message
  - First-ever meeting between leaders (symbolic opening, no deal)
  - Public solidarity statements during a crisis
  - Boycotts, expulsions, or recalls of ambassadors
  - Cultural events explicitly tied to a political agenda (propaganda screenings, ideological exhibitions)
  - Score 2.5: Weak signal. Score 3.5: Strong signal that shifts perceptions

4.0-5.0: **Framework/Intent** — Commitments exist but are non-binding or vague
  - MOUs without specific projects, timelines, or dollar amounts
  - "Working groups" or "joint committees" established
  - Trade talks initiated but no agreement reached
  - Scholarship programs or training exchanges (small scale, <100 people)
  - Score 4.0: Vague intent. Score 5.0: Named initiative with structure but no funding

5.5-6.5: **Concrete but Limited** — Specific, verifiable commitments at moderate scale
  - Signed agreements with named projects and timelines
  - Financial commitments under $100M
  - Military equipment deliveries or specific joint exercises with named assets
  - Visa agreements, direct flight routes, or trade facilitation measures
  - Humanitarian aid deliveries with specific quantities
  - Score 5.5: Single small deliverable. Score 6.5: Multiple deliverables or binding agreement

7.0-8.0: **Substantial** — Major commitments that alter bilateral dynamics
  - Financial commitments $100M-$1B
  - Infrastructure projects breaking ground (not just announced)
  - Free trade agreements or major tariff changes
  - Defense pacts, base access agreements, or major arms deals
  - Large-scale humanitarian operations (thousands of beneficiaries)
  - Score 7.0: Major single commitment. Score 8.0: Multiple major commitments or implemented (not just signed)

8.5-10.0: **Transformative** — Reshapes regional dynamics or creates lasting structural change
  - Financial commitments >$1B
  - Nuclear/energy megaprojects under construction
  - New international institutions or frameworks (BRICS expansion, SCO membership)
  - Peace agreements ending active conflicts
  - Permanent military basing or security guarantees
  - Score 8.5: Major structural shift. Score 10.0: Historic, once-in-a-decade event

**Additional Signals (adjust score ±0.5-1.0):**
- High article count (>20) suggests significant media/policy attention → adjust UP
- Multi-day coverage suggests sustained importance → adjust UP
- Multiple recipient countries involved → adjust UP
- Event is an update to a previously scored event (follow-on meeting) → adjust DOWN vs. original event
- Announcement only with no implementation evidence → adjust DOWN

**CRITICAL:** Use the full 1-10 range. Score based on the anchors above, not gut feeling. A cultural festival is a 1-2 regardless of which countries are involved. A $500M infrastructure project is a 7+ regardless of how few articles cover it. Let the substance drive the score.

  - Different orgs with similar names: SPLIT these

For COMPANY type:
  - Same company, different name forms: "Huawei Technologies" vs "Huawei"
  - Parent vs subsidiary: Generally SPLIT unless they're commonly referred to interchangeably

**Guidelines for Picking Best Name:**
1. Prefer full formal name over abbreviations: "Xi Jinping" > "Xi"

   - Significance: Why is this location mentioned?

CRITICAL GUIDELINES:
- Extract ONLY entities explicitly mentioned in the text
- For persons: Use the most complete name form (e.g., "Wang Yi" not just "Minister Wang")
- For organizations: Use official names (e.g., "Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs" not "MFA")
- For companies: Include full legal names when available
- Include context snippets that show HOW the entity is involved
- If the document doesn't mention any entities of a type, return an empty array for that type

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with this structure:

Your task is to produce a SPECIFIC event name from a document about a soft power interaction.

**THE PROBLEM:**
Generic event names like "Iran-Oman Bilateral Relations" or "China-Egypt Diplomatic Engagement" are useless for event tracking because dozens of unrelated events share the same vague label. When these get clustered, they create mega-blobs of thousands of unrelated documents.

**YOUR TASK:**
Read the document content and produce a specific event name that uniquely identifies THIS particular event, agreement, project, or initiative.

**RULES:**
1. The event name MUST reference the specific activity described (e.g., "signs port MOU", "launches Confucius Institute", "mediates nuclear talks")
2. Include key entities: named agreements, named projects, named summits, specific people when central
3. Include geographic specificity when it distinguishes the event (e.g., "Alexandria Port" not just "port")
4. The name should be specific enough that it could NOT describe a different event between the same two countries
5. Keep it under 100 characters
6. If the document describes a well-known named event (BRICS Summit, Belt and Road Forum, etc.), use the specific instance (e.g., "2024 BRICS Summit in Kazan" not just "BRICS Summit")

**GOOD event names:**
- "China-Egypt Suez Canal Economic Zone Phase 2 Expansion"
- "Oman Mediates Iran-US Nuclear Backchannel Talks, March 2025"
- "Turkey-Qatar Eagle Shield Joint Military Exercise 2024"
- "Iran Cultural Screening of 'Hezbollah is Alive' in Tehran"
- "China Funds $2B Alexandria Port Construction Project"
- "2024 Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit in Astana"

**BAD event names (too generic — NEVER produce these):**
- "China-Egypt Bilateral Relations"
- "Iran Cultural Diplomacy"
- "Turkey-Qatar Military Cooperation"
- "China Economic Engagement with Egypt"
- "Diplomatic Meeting"
- "Trade Agreement"
