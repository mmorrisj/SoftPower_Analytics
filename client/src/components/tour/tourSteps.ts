 * Step script for the guided product tour, centralized like pageGuides.ts so

 * Each step either spotlights an element (`target` is a CSS selector, usually
 * a [data-tour] attribute) or renders as a centered card when `target` is
 * omitted or the element never appears. `route` navigates before the step is
 * shown, so the tour can walk across pages.
